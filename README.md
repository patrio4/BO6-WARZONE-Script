This script has no problem with antivirus and anti-cheat of most games


Description and instructions for use:

This script makes several different tasks easier for you in the game Warzone

1-(Recoil Reduction) Recoil reduction in the range of 1 to 10, meaning that a lower number reduces your recoil more smoothly and a higher number reduces your recoil faster and lowers your mouse cursor relative to the recoil to effectively repel recoil

2-(Auto shild) By sending the G key, it can automatically fill your shield every 20 seconds, but when you are in a car, it also beeps every 20 seconds :)

3-(Slide cancel) If you set the crouch button to Ctrl and remove the C key from the key bindings, every time you press the c key, the slide cancel will be complete and there is no need to press the crouch key twice and the space key once

The entire program is activated and deactivated with the ctrl + right arrow key
The recoil amount is adjusted with the control key + up and down arrows and its number is displayed at the top of the screen
The recoil is temporarily activated and deactivated with the control key + left arrow key It is possible

Note: When the program is completely disabled, a small doll image appears on the lower right side of the monitor, which means it is disabled, and when you enable it again, that image will be hidden

Note: You can change the G key for the shield to another key in the code, but if you don't know how, use artificial intelligence to replace other hotkeys

Note:When you open the chat environment with enter, the G key, which means the shield, is automatically stopped so that the letter G is not typed unnecessarily in your chat.

With respect to the Activision company, this code is designed for educational and creative purposes only

I hope that anyone can develop it better
